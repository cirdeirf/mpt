# Most Probable Tree Algorithm

This is a Rust-based implementation of the most probable tree (mpt) algorithm
introduced in "The Problem of Computing the Most Probable Tree of a
Probabilistic Tree Automaton" and the best parse algorithm presented in
"Parsing Algorithms based on Tree Automata" by Andreas Maletti and Giorgio
Satta, 2009. More information about the mpt algorithm and the classes can be
found in the thesis itself and in the rustdoc documentation which can be
generated and opened by `cargo doc --document-private-items --open`.
